# Introduction

This is the first Petrobras' repository on GitHub. It supports the 3W project and promotes experimentation of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells. 
				
The 3W project is based on the 3W dataset, a database described in [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106223) paper, and on the 3W toolkit, a software package that promotes experimentation with the 3W dataset for specific problems. The name **3W** was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from ***3*** different sources and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells.

## Motivation

Timely detection of undesirable events in oil wells can help prevent production losses, reduce maintenance costs, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Losses related to this type of events can reach 5% of production in certain scenarios, especially in areas such as Flow Assurance and Artificial Lifting Methods. In terms of maintenance, the cost of a maritime probe, required to perform various types of operations, can exceed US $500,000 per day.

Creating a dataset and making it public to be openly experienced can greatly foment the development of tools that can:

* Improve the process of identifying undesirable events in offshore wells production;
* Increase the efficiency of monitoring the integrity of wells and subsea systems, whose related problems can generate invaluable losses for people, environment, and company's image.

## Strategy

The 3W is the pilot of a Petrobras' program called [Conexões para Inovação - Módulo Open Lab](https://tecnologia.petrobras.com.br/modulo-open-lab.html). This pilot is an ***open project*** composed by two major resources:

* The [3W dataset](#3w-dataset), which will be evolved and supplemented with more instances from time to time; 
* The [3W toolkit](#3w-toolkit), which will also be evolved (in many ways) to cover an increasing number of undesirable events during its development.

Therefore, our strategy is to make these resources publicly available so that we can develop the 3W project with a global community collaboratively.

## Ambition

With this project, Petrobras intends to develop (fix, improve, supplement, etc.):

* The [3W dataset](#3w-dataset) itself;
* The [3W toolkit](#3w-toolkit) itself;
* Approaches and algorithms that can be incorporated into systems dedicated to monitoring undesirable events in offshore oil wells during their respective production phases;
* Tools that can be useful for our ambition.

## Contributions

We expect to receive various types of contributions from individuals, research institutions, startups, companies and partner oil operators.

Before you can contribute to this project, you need to read and agree to the following documents:

* [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md);
* [CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md);
* [CONTRIBUTING GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md).

It is also very important to know, participate and follow the discussions. See the discussions section.

## Licenses

## Questions

See the discussions section. If you don't get clarification, please open discussions to ask your questions so we can answer them.

# 3W dataset

To the best of its authors' knowledge, this is the first realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells that can be readily used as a benchmark dataset for development of machine learning techniques related to inherent difficulties of actual data. For more information about the theory behind this dataset, refer to the paper **A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells** published in the **Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering** (link [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106223)). 

## Structure

The 3W dataset consists of all CSV files in the subdirectories of the [dataset](dataset) directory and structured as detailed [here](3W_DATASET_STRUCTURE.md). 

## Overview

A 3W dataset's general presentation with some quantities and statistics is available in [this](overviews/_baseline/main.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

# 3W toolkit

The 3W toolkit is a software package written in Python 3 that contains resources that make the following easier:

* [3W dataset](#3w-dataset) overview generation;
* Experimentation and comparative analysis of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells during their respective production phases;
* Standardization of key points of the Machine Learning-based algorithm development pipeline.

It is important to note that there are arbitrary choices in this toolkit, but they have been carefully made to allow adequate comparative analysis without compromising the ability to experiment with different approaches and algorithms.

## Structure

The 3W toolkit is implemented in sub-modules as discribed [here](3W_TOOLKIT_STRUCTURE.md).

## Incorporated Problems

Specific problems will be incorporated into this project gradually. At this point, we can work on:

* [Binary classifier of Spurious Closure of DHSV](problems/01_binary_classifier_of_spurious_closure_of_dhsv/README.md).

All specification is detailed in the [CONTRIBUTING GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Examples of Use

The list below with examples of how to use the 3W toolkit will be incremented throughout its development.

* 3W dataset's overviews:
  * [Baseline](overviews/_baseline/main.ipynb)
* Binary classifier of Spurious Closure of DHSV:
  * [Baseline](problems/01_binary_classifier_of_spurious_closure_of_dhsv/_baseline/main.ipynb)
