## üèóÔ∏è Toolkit Architecture

The 3WToolkit v2.0.0 follows a modular architecture with clear separation between application-level components and core configuration systems:

### Application Layer
The application layer contains the main functional modules that users interact with:

- **Dataset**: `ParquetDataset` - Handles data loading and management
- **Preprocessing**: `ImputeMissing`, `Normalize`, `Windowing`, `RenameColumns` - Data preparation modules
- **Feature Extractors**: `ExtractStatisticalFeatures`, `ExtractWaveletFeatures`, `ExtractEWStatisticalFeatures` - Feature engineering
- **Models**: `SklearnModels`, `MLP` - Machine learning model implementations
- **Plots**: `DataVisualization` - Visualization and plotting capabilities
- **Assessment**: `ModelAssessment`, `ReportGeneration` - Model evaluation and reporting
- **Standalone Modules**: `BaseStep`, `Pipeline`, `ModelTrainer` - Core workflow components

### Core Layer
The core layer provides configuration and foundational components:

- **Configuration Modules**: Each application module has a corresponding `*Config` class for parameter management
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics including `AccuracyScoreConfig`, `PrecisionScoreConfig`, `RecallScoreConfig`, `F1ScoreConfig`, `RocAucScoreConfig`, etc.
- **Enumerators**: Type-safe enumerations for `ModelTypeEnum`, `DataSplit`, `CriterionEnum`, `TaskType`, `EventPrefixEnum`, `OptimizersEnum`, `ActivationFunctionEnum`
- **Base Classes**: Abstract base classes that define interfaces and common functionality
