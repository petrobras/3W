Before accepting contributions from you that is not a Petrobras' employee, we need that you must first sign one of our Contributor License Agreements (CLAs), which are based on the Apache Software Foundation's CLAs:

* ICLA: [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf)
* CCLA: [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.pdf)

A CLA only needs to be signed once and it covers all Petrobras' projects in GitHub. This allows you to retain your ownership in the code submitted while granting Petrobras the necessary legal rights to use that contribution. 

Here we have links to sign a new agreement on behalf of [Only Yourself](clas/individual_cla) or [Your Employer](clas/corporate_cla).
