def rolling_window(array, window=(0,), asteps=None, wsteps=None, axes=None, toend=True):
    """Create a view of `array` which for every point gives the n-dimensional
    neighbourhood of size window. New dimensions are added at the end of
    `array` or after the corresponding original dimension.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array_like
        Array to which the rolling window is applied.
    window : int or tuple
        Either a single integer to create a window of only the last axis or a
        tuple to create it for the last len(window) axes. 0 can be used as a
        to ignore a dimension in the window.
    asteps : tuple
        Aligned at the last axis, new steps for the original array, ie. for
        creation of non-overlapping windows. (Equivalent to slicing result)
    wsteps : int or tuple (same size as window)
        steps for the added window dimensions. These can be 0 to repeat values
        along the axis.
    axes: int or tuple
        If given, must have the same size as window. In this case window is
        interpreted as the size in the dimension given by axes. IE. a window
        of (2, 1) is equivalent to window=2 and axis=-2.       
    toend : bool
        If False, the new dimensions are right after the corresponding original
        dimension, instead of at the end of the array. Adding the new axes at the
        end makes it easier to get the neighborhood, however toend=False will give
        a more intuitive result if you view the whole array.
    
    Returns
    -------
    A view on `array` which is smaller to fit the windows and has windows added
    dimensions (0s not counting), ie. every point of `array` is an array of size
    window.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3)
    >>> rolling_window(a, (2,2))
    array([[[[0, 1],
             [3, 4]],

            [[1, 2],
             [4, 5]]],


           [[[3, 4],
             [6, 7]],

            [[4, 5],
             [7, 8]]]])
    
    Or to create non-overlapping windows, but only along the first dimension:
    >>> rolling_window(a, (2,0), asteps=(2,1))
    array([[[0, 3],
            [1, 4],
            [2, 5]]])
    
    Note that the 0 is discared, so that the output dimension is 3:
    >>> rolling_window(a, (2,0), asteps=(2,1)).shape
    (1, 3, 2)
    
    This is useful for example to calculate the maximum in all (overlapping)
    2x2 submatrixes:
    >>> rolling_window(a, (2,2)).max((2,3))
    array([[4, 5],
           [7, 8]])
           
    Or delay embedding (3D embedding with delay 2):
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> rolling_window(x, 3, wsteps=2)
    array([[0, 2, 4],
           [1, 3, 5],
           [2, 4, 6],
           [3, 5, 7],
           [4, 6, 8],
           [5, 7, 9]])
