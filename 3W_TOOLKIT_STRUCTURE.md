The 3W toolkit is a software package written in Python 3 structured in the following sub-modules:

* **base**: groups the objects used by the other sub-modules;
* **dev**: has all the resources related to development of Machine 
Learning models;
* **misc**: brings together diverse resources that do not fit in the 
other sub-modules;
* **rolling_window**: creates a view of array which for every point 
gives the n-dimensional neighbourhood of size window. New dimensions are 
added at the end of array or after the corresponding original dimension.
